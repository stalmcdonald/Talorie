    <string name="calorie_tips"> 1. Read Your Food Labels \n Food labels will tell you exactly how many calories, carbohydrate, protein and fat are in the foods you’re eating. The trick is to first look at the portion size on the top of the food label to know how much of the food contains the calories listed. Also keep track of how many portions you’re eating. For example if a portion size is one slice of bread and you eat a sandwich made of two slices, you’ll have to double the calories listed on the label. \n \n \n  2. Know Your Portion Sizes \n  Be as specific as possible when recording food and pay close attention to food labels.</string>
